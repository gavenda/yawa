# Yawa - general all-in-one plugin for any of my personally deployed minecraft servers.
#
# https://github.com/gavenda/yawa
#
# The main reason this plugin was created so I can instantly get server up to date with any Spigot updates or fix
# any errors I found and also remove unnecessary features I don't really want.
#
# This is simply micro optimizing, and yes, I'm doing it for evil.
