# Yawa
All in one plugin for any of my personally hosted minecraft servers. 
Most of its code bases are taken from popular plugins.

The sole purpose of this is to take whatever feature I want, simplify it as much as possible.
Avoiding plugin conflict hell in general.

This really is just for use in a simple SMP server for friends.

All code is licensed under [GNU GPLv3](LICENSE).

## Feature Set
- Sleep
- Toggle Armor Visibility
- Ping in Scoreboard
